This project is about developing a mathematical setup using an Arduino board, creating a mesh network of transceivers, and writing a program on LabView to analyze the data obtained.
This paper gives an overview of the Arduino boards and their capabilities for developing
methetics. Different sensors used to measure
Weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, humidity, and air pressure.
To create a wireless data transmission network between the weather station and
The mesh technology was used to transfer data between the meteorological station and the base station. The principles of
of the mesh network operation, and transmitters have been set up to provide a stable connection.
Special attention is paid to LabView programming. A program has been developed that can read data from the Meteotest, analyze them, and
visualize them in a convenient way.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the developed meteothetics setup, as well as the functionality of the LabView program for
processing and presentation of data. The work can be used as a basis for further research in the field of meteorology and weather-monitoring systems.
